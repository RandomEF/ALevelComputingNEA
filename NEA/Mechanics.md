Morality of killing things - will affect a sanity meter
Game tracks everything, Dishonoured-esque
Flower planting system
	Bullets contain seeds
	Grow as time goes on
	Return to level/place, may be flowers/stages of plants
	Based on save time

Movement abilities are slowly granted to the player through unlocks and swapping out body parts
The player starts each level with a basic toolkit, which is integrated in the player's body
The player can pick up the weapons of enemies
	Can even snatch them from enemies

Level access is done with a hub system similar to Doom Eternal and Donkey Kong 64
	Will be transported to a cyberspace to select the level

Character Creation
Throwback Grenades - can be implemented by having the grenades temporarily swap into the melee slot
Grenades can be implemented as another weapon, so that it takes the standard slots
## Scoring

Each level is scored based on:
- Time to complete
- Enemies killed (this will end up backfiring on the player later)
- Secrets collected
- Inverse of death count
Further point bonuses will be granted for:
- Using less weapons
- No deaths
- Pacifist (only applied on the final level if the player has killed 0 enemies across the whole save)

This should encourage players to return to the level and get a higher score, potentially seeing the flower planting system
The score will be displayed in a room, and the player can interact with each of the elements to show the score for each category

## Merit

Currency is called Merit
The score of the level will grant merit
Merit can also be picked up from within the level
Kills will grant more merit
Merit will be used to gain upgrades to the character, but not unlocks

## Sanity

The sanity meter is a measure of how aligned to the default programming the player is.
Pacifism goes against the original programming - decreases sanity meter
Kills follow the original programming - increases sanity meter
Secrets decrease sanity meter

A lower sanity meter - the player is questioning the morality of what they've always been taught
	Decreases health regeneration speed
	Increases damage taken
	Player will see hallucinations
		Can attack friendlies
		Relates to PTSD type event at the beginning of the game
A higher sanity meter - the player believes what they have been taught is the right thing
	Increases health regeneration speed
	Decreases damage taken

Works with moral - doing the right thing is almost always harder than doing the wrong thing
