You are not the main character
	Aid to the actual main character
The main character is idolised as a hero within the country/empire, but this is all just government propaganda and teaching immoral concepts as 'good' to the public.
Outside of the country/empire, the main character is the greatest villain, committing unspeakable acts

The player starts of as a basic combat robot, assigned to assist the main character
The better the player conforms to the teachings of the country, the more merit they get, allowing them to upgrade themselves, and maybe be better use to the main character
