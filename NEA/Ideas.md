RPG
Top down shooter
Bullet hell
Movement-based
Rogue-like
Sandbox
Survival
Idle
VR

## Other Ideas

Autocorrect
Game engine
Own programming language

## Engines/Languages

Unity - C#
	Already known
	Questionable
Unreal - C++
	Must completely learn
	Must also learn C++
	Very useful later on
Godot - GDScript
	Must completely learn
	Apparently very similar to Python
	May be useful later on
Pygame - Python
	Have dabbled in past
	No graphical interface
	May be tough to implement 3D
RPG Maker
	Useful for RPG (obvs)
Be an absolute joke
	Do assembly

| Movement first-person-shooter game | A game where the player must simultaneously manage their momentum and there aim      | Medium - ample use of math and GUI. Movement must be fine-tuned along with movement based bug fixes. Player physics, and bullet physics, enemy AI, and modular interconnected components, OOP, libraries | C#, C++, GDScript, Python, easier with engines | OOP, database, modular design, abstraction for the GUI, reusability for functions      |
| Game engine                        | An application designed to help and aid someone in the creation of game or other app | Very - lots of math, OOP, GUI, implementing a physics engine, along with functionality for any component, must include compilers and built in libraries to assist in building the game                   | C#, C++                                        | OOP, decomposition of functions                                                        |
| Programming language               | Writing a language and run it either being compiled, or to interpreted               | Easy - filled with mainly trees and if statements, and exception raising, must have built in functions, handle memory and add basic data structures                                                      | C#, C++, CPython                               | Selection, trees, decomposition and modular design for different parts of the compiler |
### Reasoning

The game engine is far too complex and time consuming for the constraint of time, while also requiring more learning than either of the other options. The programming language on the other hand, is more simple and would not allow me to easily incorporate as many computational methods. The movement first-person-shooter game is a great medium between the complexity of the two other options, while also allowing me to incorporate a great deal of creativity and interesting implementations of the course content.
